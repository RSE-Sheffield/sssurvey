# University of Sheffield Software Survey

## Major Findings

* 382 respondants.
* 91% of respondants use research software ([92% nationally](https://zenodo.org/record/1183562#.YMnQFahKiUk)).
* 65% report that software is vital to their research (nationally, 69% report that "It would not be practical to conduct my work without software").
* 27% develop their own code ([56% nationally](https://zenodo.org/record/1183562#.YMnQFahKiUk)).
* 69% (of the 27% subset who responded to this question) feel they have **not had sufficient training** to develop reliable software.
* Of the 54% of respondants who are involved with writing funding proposals, 45% expected to write software as part of the proposal.
* Of those who expected to write software, 40% did not request funding for this (compared to [20%, nationally](https://zenodo.org/record/1183562#.YMnQFahKiUk)).

## Introduction

## Sample characteristics

- ToDo: Sampling bias in this survey and those we're comparing with. 
  - TUoS survey went to all PhD students and research staff with a prize incentive.
  - 2020 Southampton survey went to *"all staff employed on an ERE contract (Education, Research and Enterprise) and all PhD students"* with a prize incentive. As surveys were sent out on a faculty by faculty basis, it was possible to report a response rate of between 8% and 11% for all faculties.
  - 2014 national survey - it is not clear what sampling strategy was used.
## Prevalence and importance of research software

**91% of participants report that they use research software** (defined as *"...any software you have used in the generation of a result that you expect to appear in a publication. This might be anything from a few-line script to clean some data, to a fully fledged software suite. It includes code you have written yourself and code written by someone else."* in the survey form). A 2014 study reports that [nationally this is **92%**](https://zenodo.org/record/1183562#.YMnQFahKiUk), another from the University of Southampton in 2020 [reports **95%**](https://github.com/Southampton-RSG/soton_software_survey_analysis_2019/blob/master/report/Research%20software%20at%20the%20University%20of%20Southampton.pdf).

This indicates that research software is critical for researchers at the University of Sheffield, and that this is not exceptional.

*Do you use research software?*

This is the vast majority of participants and indicates that research software is near ubiqitous amongst researchers at the University of Sheffield.

Participants were asked to express how important research software is to their work, with 1 being *"Not at all"*, and 5 *"Vital"*.

*How important is research software to your work?*

65% of participants reported that research software is vital to their work.

## Software development practise

Only 27% of our participants had developed their own code. This compares with 56% nationally. This could be because a smaller proportion of researchers at the University of Sheffield develop code than that for the whole country, or due to sampling bias. In the 2020 Southampton survey, which records an 8% to 11% response rate accross faculties, 33% report developing their own software - much closer to our figure. This is consistent with the national survey response having been somewhat biased towards people more engaged with software. Nonetheless, this remains a large proportion of researchers.
