# University of Sheffield Software Survey

## Major Findings

* 382 respondants.
* 91% of respondants use research software ([92% nationally](https://zenodo.org/record/1183562#.YMnQFahKiUk)).
* 65% report that software is vital to their research (nationally, 69% report that "It would not be practical to conduct my work without software").
* 27% develop their own code ([56% nationally](https://zenodo.org/record/1183562#.YMnQFahKiUk)).
* 69% (of the 27% subset who responded to this question) feel they have **not had sufficient training** to develop reliable software.
* Of the 54% of respondants who are involved with writing funding proposals, 45% expected to write software as part of the proposal.
* Of those who expected to write software, 40% did not request funding for this (compared to [20%, nationally](https://zenodo.org/record/1183562#.YMnQFahKiUk)).

## Introduction

## Results and discussion

### Sample characteristics

### Research software use

**91% of participants report that they use research software** (defined as *"...any software you have used in the generation of a result that you expect to appear in a publication. This might be anything from a few-line script to clean some data, to a fully fledged software suite. It includes code you have written yourself and code written by someone else."* in the survey form). A 2014 study reports that [nationally this is **92%**](https://zenodo.org/record/1183562#.YMnQFahKiUk), another from the University of Southampton in 2020 [reports **95%**](https://github.com/Southampton-RSG/soton_software_survey_analysis_2019/blob/master/report/Research%20software%20at%20the%20University%20of%20Southampton.pdf).

This indicates that research software is critical for researchers at the University of Sheffield, and that this is not exceptional.

*Do you use research software?*

This is the vast majority of participants and indicates that research software is near ubiqitous amongst researchers at the University of Sheffield.

Participants were asked to express how important research software is to their work, with 1 being *"Not at all"*, and 5 *"Vital"*.

*How important is research software to your work?*

65% of participants reported that research software is vital to their work.
