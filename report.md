## Executive Summary

## Introduction

## Results and discussion

### Sample characteristics



### Research software use

**91% of participants report that they use research software** (defined as "...any software you have used in the generation of a result that you expect to appear in a publication. This might be anything from a few-line script to clean some data, to a fully fledged software suite. It includes code you have written yourself and code written by someone else." in the survey form). A 2014 study reports that nationally this is **92%** (https://zenodo.org/record/1183562#.YMnQFahKiUk), another from 2020 reports **95%** (https://github.com/Southampton-RSG/soton_software_survey_analysis_2019/blob/master/report/Research%20software%20at%20the%20University%20of%20Southampton.pdf).

This indicates that research software is very important to researchers at the University of Sheffield, and that this is not exceptional.
