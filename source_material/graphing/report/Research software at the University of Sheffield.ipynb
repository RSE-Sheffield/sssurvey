    "**Most research would not be possible without software. It is the enabling technology behind major advances, from decoding the human genome to the discovery of the Higgs boson, it lies at the heart of strategically important technologies, such as artificial intelligence, and it is a tool of constant use and fundamental importance in day-to-day research. Despite its pivotal role, support for software and software skills within academia has not kept pace with the rapid adoption of software as a research tool. This is a major barrier that inhibits research and puts results at risk.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2014 study [1] found that 92% of UK researchers use software and 69% report that it is fundamental to their research. It is not possible to disentangle the reliability of the software used to generate results from the reliability of the research itself. Unreliable software leads to unreliable results that cannot be trusted. Trust cannot be established in poorly engineered software, because it is too difficult to understand whether the software is reliable. Without trust, researchers will not build on existing software and will instead recreate it themselves: an avoidable duplication of effort and a waste of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2019, the Southampton Research Software Group (SRSG) [2] conducted a survey of research staff to identify the relationship between software and research at the University of Southampton. The SRSG works across faculties to provide software engineering expertise and training to researchers. The survey found that software use is near ubiquitous across all but one faculty, researchers report that software is vital to their work, a third of researchers develop their own software, and around a third who develop software are interested in commercialisation. Worryingly, around two thirds of staff who develop software do not believe they have had sufficient training to develop reliable software.\n",

    "Software has an almost unparalleled power to advance research and enterprise. Much of this potential is likely to remain unrealised at the University, unless researchers are given access to the necessary software skills and expertise."

    "Around a third of researchers develop their own software, but there is significantly more development occurring in Engineering and Physical Sciences despite software use in that faculty being similar to the other faculties. The cause for this imbalance is not known, but helping more faculties develop their own software could present a major opportunity for increasing the speed, scale and reliability of their research.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a significant interest in commercialising software, but much of the potential is limited by software that is not yet ready to be shared with commercial partners. This indicates a lack of access to skills and the time needed to conduct software development.\n",

    "Although researchers who develop their own software rate their software-development expertise quite highly, almost two-thirds do not believe that they have received sufficient training to develop reliable software. Objective questions based around software-engineering expertise indicate that few researchers possess professional expertise with software. The combination of near-ubiquitous software use, vital software importance and low software-development expertise is an obvious area of concern for the University. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite almost half of researchers expecting to develop software when writing their funding proposals, only around half included costs for software development in the proposal and only 19% have recruited a software expert specifically for this role. This indicates that much software is developed at the University by people whose main area of expertise is not software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "69% of researchers stated that hiring a full-time software developer would be unsuitable for their needs. This is likely due to difficulties in recruitment and in providing sufficient funds and work to retain a full-time developer. The Southampton Research Software Group, like the RSE groups that exist in 27 other universities across the UK, allow researchers to hire a Research Software Engineer when they need one. The researcher gains access to a range of professional software engineering expertise that very few, if any, research groups possess, and they only pay for this expertise when it is needed. Researchers need not concern themselves with recruitment or line management of the Research Software Engineer. Based on these benefits, it is unsurprising that nearly 70% of researchers find the RSE model for recruiting expertise either perfect or suitable.\n"
