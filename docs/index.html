<h1>Major Findings</h1>
<ul>
<li>382 respondents.</li>
<li>91% of respondents use research software (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1183562#.YMnQFahKiUk">92% nationally</a>).</li>
<li>65% report that software is vital to their research (nationally, 69% report that “It would not be practical to conduct my work without software”).</li>
<li>27% develop their own code (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1183562#.YMnQFahKiUk">56% nationally</a>).</li>
<li>69% (of the 27% subset who responded to this question) feel they have <strong>not had sufficient training</strong> to develop reliable software.</li>
<li>Of the 54% of respondents who are involved with writing funding proposals, 45% expected to write software as part of the proposal.</li>
<li>Of those who expected to write software, 40% did not request funding for this (compared to <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1183562#.YMnQFahKiUk">20%, nationally</a>).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="recommendations" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<ul>
<li>Investigate why 69% of respondents feel they have not had sufficient training.</li>
<li>Provide training / support to increase researcher confidence with version control, continuous integration and unit testing.</li>
<li>Investigate why participants responded as they did to a question about level of support for software development. Create a target for this and monitor performance against it.</li>
<li>Provide additional support to researchers to make research software outputs not intended for commercialisation freely available.</li>
<li>Discover if any action can be taken to help researchers would like to use University of Sheffield HPC but don’t currently use to do so.</li>
<li>Advocate for researchers to include costs for software development in their funding applications.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="sample-characteristics" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Sample characteristics</h1>
<p>This survey and those we make comparisons with used different sampling strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>This survey went to all PhD students and research staff with a prize incentive.</li>
<li>A 2020 Southampton survey went to <em>“all staff employed on an ERE contract (Education, Research and Enterprise) and all PhD students”</em> with a prize incentive. As surveys were sent out on a faculty by faculty basis, it was possible to report a response rate of between 8% and 11% for all faculties.</li>
<li>2014 national survey - it is not clear what sampling strategy was used.</li>
</ul>
